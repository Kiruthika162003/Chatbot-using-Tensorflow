**Chatbot Using Machine Learning**

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple chatbot using machine learning techniques. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of questions and answers, and it can generate responses based on user input.

**Prerequisites**

Python (version 3.6 or above)
TensorFlow (version 2.0 or above)
NumPy
Tokenizers (included in TensorFlow)

**How It Works**

**Data Preparation:**
The dataset of questions and answers is defined in the questions and answers arrays.
The text data is tokenized using the Tokenizer class from TensorFlow. The tokenizer assigns a unique numerical index to each word in the dataset.

**Model Architecture:**
The chatbot model is built using the Keras API from TensorFlow.
It consists of an embedding layer, two GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers, and a dense layer.
The embedding layer converts the tokenized input sequences into dense vector representations.
The GRU layers process the input sequences, capturing the context and dependencies within the data.
The dense layer performs the final classification, predicting the most appropriate word as the response.

**Model Training:**
The model is compiled with the sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
The training data, consisting of the tokenized input and output sequences, is fed into the model for training.
The model iterates over the data for the specified number of epochs, adjusting the weights to minimize the loss and improve accuracy.

**Generating Responses:**
The generate_response function takes user input, tokenizes it, and feeds it into the trained model.
The model predicts the index of the most probable word as the response.
The predicted index is then converted back into text using the tokenizer's index-word mapping.
